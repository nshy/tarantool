# This script checks that current branch has most recent entrypoint tag.
# There are 2 cases when we require entrypoint tag.
#
# 1. After release tag (like 2.10.5, 2.11.0 etc). We require that the next
# commit has annotated tag
#
# 2. After branching. For example we develop 3.0.0 in master. And decide
# to release 3.0.0. We fork release/3.0 branch. The first commit after
# fork in release/3.0 branch is required to has annotated tag (like 3.0.0-rc1
# or something). The first commit after fork in master branch is required
# to has annotated entrypoint tag too.
#
# Note that in both cases we do not check that required annotated tag has
# "entrypoint" or "rc" in the name.
#
# We check for most recent entrypoint tag only. Most recent in a sense that
# for example if there are tags for releases 2.10.0 and 2.10.1 on current
# branch the script only check for entrypoint tag after 2.10.1 tag.
